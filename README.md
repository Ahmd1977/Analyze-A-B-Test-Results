This project will assure you have mastered the subjects covered in the statistics lessons. We have organized the current notebook into the following sections:

    Introduction
    Part I - Probability
    Part II - A/B Test
    Part III - Regression
    Final Check
    Submission

Specific programming tasks are marked with a ToDo tag.

Introduction

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. For this project, I will use my different tools and what I learned about statics in this chapter to check and understanding the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. My goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should:

    Implement the new webpage,
    Keep the old webpage, or
    Perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
